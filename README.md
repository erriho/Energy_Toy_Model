# Energy_Toy_Model

- In _debugging.ipynb_ you can find the market clearing test and the model implementation in simple scenarios
- In _Toy_Model.ipynb_ you can find the model implementation in a more complex scenario and some explorations over the parameter space
- In the _Data_ folder you can find the synthetic dataset I used in the notebooks.

I apologize for the messiness of it all =) In the upcoming future, I might invest some time organizing the code in a more useful way.
